# Bit manipulation, Programming using I/O Ports and Counter programs.

## Examples

1. Write a program to create a square wave of 50% duty cycle on bit 0 of Port-1.

2. Write a program to create a square wave of 66% duty cycle on bit 0 of Port-1.

3. Assuming that clock pulses fed into pin T1, write a program for counter 1 in mode2 to count the pulses and display the state of the TL1 count on P2.

4. Implement a 2-digit decimal up counter and display the counts on Port-2 pins.

5. Implement a 16- bit hexadecimal up counter and update the counts in register R0 and R1 register.

## Exercises

1. Implement an 8 bit ring counter.

2. Assuming R1:R0 registers as an 16 bit register rotate the content of this register left such that bit-7 of R0 becomes bit 0 of R1 and bit-7 of R1 becomes bit-0 of R0.

3. Implement an 8-bit octal up counter.

4. Program Timer-1 to be an event counter in Mode-2 and display the decimal count on P0,P1 and P2 continuously. Set the initial count to 99.

## Practice problems

1. Implement a 16-bit down counter.

2. Set the carry flag to 0 if the number in accumulator is even, else reset the carry flag.

3. Implement a 4 digit decimal down counter and display the counts on ports.

4. Program timer 1 to generate the square wave of 1 KHz. Assume crystal frequency is
11.0592 MHz
