START:
	CLR C 				; CLEAR CARRY

	MOV A, R1 			; GET HIGHER BYTE IN ACCUMULATOR

	; IF BIT-7 OF HIGHER BYTE IS 0 => ALLOW CARRY BIT TO BE 0, AND SKIP TO ROTATIONS
	JNB ACC.7, ROTATIONS 		; ACC.7 => BIT-7 OF ACCUMULATOR A

	; BIT-7 OF HIGHER BYTE IS NOT 0; => CHANGE CARRY BIT TO BE 1;
	SETB C 				; SET THE CARRY BIT

ROTATIONS:
	MOV A, R0 			; GET LOWER BYTE IN ACCUMULATOR
	RLC A 				; ROTATE LEFT ACCUMULATOR, WHICH HAS THE LOWER BYTE
	MOV R0, A 			; STORE LOWER BYTE IN (R0)

	; THE CARRY BIT IS NOW THE BIT-7 OF THE LOWER BYTE

	MOV A, R1 			; GET HIGHER BYTE IN THE ACCUMULATOR AGAIN
	RLC A 				; ROTATE LEFT ACCUMULATOR, WHICH HAS THE HIGHER BYTE
	MOV R1, A 			; STORE HIGHER BYTE IN (R1)
