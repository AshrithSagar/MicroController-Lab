<code># Arithmetic and Logical operations

## Examples

1. Write a program to find sum of 5 bytes available in RAM locations 40h to 45h. Store the result in Reg A (low byte) and R7 (high byte).

2. Write program to add two 16-bit numbers 2E5Fh and A3B4h. Store the sum in R7 and R6.

3. Write program to perform multiplication of two numbers. Two 8-bit numbers are available in memory location 1000h and 1001h. Copy the product into 1002h and 1003h.

4. Perform division of two numbers. The numbers are available in 2000h and 2001h data memory. After division operation, store the result in 200Ah and 200Bh.

5. Perform the logical AND operation of two 8-bit data available in R0 and R1 and output the result to Port-2.

6. Perform NOT operation on a data and output the result to Port-1.

## Exercises

1. Find the difference of two 2-digit BCD numbers available in R1 and R2 and store the result in location 2000h.

2. Add two 32-bit numbers available in memory locations starting from 3050h and store the result from memory location 3080h.

3. Multiply two 16-bit hex numbers and store the product.

## Practice problems

1. Find the difference of two 16 bit numbers available in memory location XX50h and XX52h and store the result in XX5Ah.

2. Add two 4-digit BCD numbers available in memory external data memory and store the result in internal RAM location 00h.

3. Multiply two 2-digit BCD numbers.

4. Divide two 2-digit BCD numbers available in memory locations and store the quotient and remainder.

5. Perform multiplication by shift and add method.
